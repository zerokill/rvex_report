In 2007 I have started studying Electronic Engineering and Design at the University of applied sciences Utrecht. After graduating in 2011 I decided to persue a degree in Computer Engineering at the Technical University Delft. This thesis reflects the new things I have learned since beginning my study at the Electrical Engineering Department.

First I would like to thank my advisor Stephan Wong for giving me the opportunity and advising me during the writing of this thesis.

Secondly I would like to thank RoÃ«l Seedorf, Anthony Brandon and Joost Hoozemans for their discussions and help during the realization of this project. Their advice has proven to be priceless.

I would like to thank my friends and family for all the support they have given me over the years.
