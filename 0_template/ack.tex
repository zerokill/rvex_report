In 2007 I started studying Electronic Engineering and Design at the University of applied sciences Utrecht. After graduating in 2011 I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering at the Technical University Delft. This thesis reflects the new things I have learned since beginning my study at the Electrical Engineering Department.

Firstly I would like to thank my advisor Stephan Wong for giving me the opportunity to work on this subject. Secondly, I would like to thank RoÃ«l Seedorf, Anthony Brandon and Joost Hoozemans for their discussions and help during the realization of this project. Their advice has proven to be priceless.

And of course I would like to thank my friends and family for all the support they have given me over the years.
