This thesis describes the development of a LLVM-based compiler for the $\rho$-VEX processor. The $\rho$-VEX processor is a runtime reconfigurable VLIW processor. Currently two compilers exist that target the $\rho$-VEX processor: a HP-VEX compiler and a GCC-based compiler.

We will show that both compilers have disadvantages that are impossible or very difficult to fix. Thats is why we have build a LLVM-based compiler that targets the $\rho$-VEX processor. The LLVM-based compiler can be parameterized in a way similar to the HP-VEX compiler. Further we will present certain optimizations that are new for LLVM-based compilers. These optimizations include a custom machine scheduler that avoids structural and data hazards in the generated binaries.

Finally we will demonstrate the operations of the LLVM-based compiler and compare the performance of generated binaries with the existing compilers. We will show that the LLVM-based compiler exceeds the performance and code quality of the GCC-based compiler. Binaries generated with the HP-VEX compiler outperform those of the LLVM-based compiler.
