\chapter{Verification and Results}
\label{chap:results}
In this chapter we are going to discuss the verfication of the LLVM compiler and the performance of the binaries that are generated with the LLVM compiler.

\section{Verification}
The correct operation of a compiler is extremely important

\section{Benchmark results}
Comparison to GCC and HP-VEX

Different issue widths

Different optimization levels

\section{Generic binary}
Comparison to GCC

Different issue widths
